üè¶ Bank Management System ‚Äì Front End (React.js)
üìÑ Description
This project is the front-end for a Bank Management System built with React.js. The application allows employees to log in and view financial data such as transaction history, account balances, and loan details. It connects to a backend API for data retrieval and updates.

The front-end was developed with React.js, and the backend is housed in a separate repository. You can connect the two by following the instructions below.

Backend: Java Spring Boot (separate repository)

Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT)

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

üîó How to Connect Frontend with Backend
The front-end connects to the backend API hosted on a local server (http://localhost:8080). If you wish to connect this front-end with your own backend, follow these steps:

Clone the back-end repository from GitHub (ensure it‚Äôs running on localhost:8080).

Make sure the CORS policy on your backend allows requests from the React front-end.

In the src/axios.js file, change the API_BASE_URL to point to your backend URL:

js
Copy
const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080";  // Update this URL if needed
Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

Frontend: Run npm install in the React project.

Backend: Set up and run the Spring Boot application as per the backend's instructions.

Run both servers locally, and the front-end should interact with the backend for transactions, loan management, and authentication.
